# Signing into Github for the First Time

When you sign in to Github for the first time, you'll need to create a new account using the "sign-in" button.

Before you do: decide what you want people to type when they visit your website. For instance, when you visit Github, you type "github.com".

The username you choose in the sign-in step will determine what the address of your website is. For instance, our sample publication is titled "The Tuberculosis Specimen", so the username is "tuberculosisspecimen"

You'll also need the usual things: an email address, proof that you're not a robot (you'll have to rotate an object until it matches the image Github shows you), and a little bit of information about how you're going to use Github (website hosting).

When you're asked to choose between a free and paid account, choose the "free" option. This means that people can see, but not edit, the files that run your web site.
