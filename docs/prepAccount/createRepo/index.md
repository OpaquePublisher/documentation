# Creating a New Github Repository

When you first create a new Github account, it will be empty and you'll be prompted to create a new "repository". Repositories are Github's word for "collections of files and folders that are related to each other."

Instead of creating a new repository that's blank, you'll make a copy of the OOPP template repository.

1. Visit the OOPP template repository at [https://github.com/OpaquePublisher/template](https://github.com/OpaquePublisher/template)
1. Look for the green "Use this template" button on the right-hand side of the page
1. Choose "Create a new repository"
1. Look for the line that contains two fields: "Owner" and "Repository Name"". You should see your new Github account name in the "Owner" field. Your repository name should be "[youraccountname].github.io". For instance, our sample username is "tuberculosisspecimen" so we would type `tuberculosisspecimen.github.io` in the "Repository Name" field.
1. Leave the repository setting on "Public". People will be able to see, but not edit, the files that run your web site.
1. Press the green "Create repository" button.

This will copy all of the example files you need to get started into a repository that only you have editing privileges for.
